# IIM-Analytics-Intern

This project involves Analysing Youtube comments of the chess related videos and how the comments have generally changed over the years and how it reflects change
in people's interest over the years, I have taken mainly 2 Youtube channels that's popular in india in the topic of Chess they are ChessBaseIndia and SamayRaina.

[Channel Analysis](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/IIM-Analytics-Intern/blob/main/ChessBase_India_and_SamayRaina_Channel_Analysis.ipynb) - This Python Notebook analyse both Channel's general stats (views,likes,subscribers) and find the most popular videos of each channel in 2020,2021,2022 based on (views+likes).


[Cleaning_Comments](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/IIM-Analytics-Intern/blob/main/Preprocessing_Youtube_Comments.ipynb) - Youtube Comments contains lots of unwanted 
symbols,emojis that is of lesser use for our purpose and also contains foreign language texts so this Python Notebook aides in cleaning all the comments.


[Topic_Modelling](https://github.com/Haarish-dev/IIM-Analytics-Intern/blob/main/Topic_Modelling.ipynb) - There are lots of Topic Modelling Approach and the important and the most common one is LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and should not to be confused with LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis).This python notebook continues from the previous notebook and coherence score is analysed w.r.t number of topics, still there is room to improvement regarding tuning the values of alpha and beta.
